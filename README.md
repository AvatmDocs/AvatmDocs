Advanced Virtual Automated Teller Machine
README.MD 

// A Network that includes a Token and a Coin. 
The symbol is AVATM for the Coin and AVAT for the Token
The network exists on the Bitcoin Cash Simple 
Ledger Protocol network and blockchain.

  The Coin is the medium of exchange for the network that exists in 
the physical or "Parent" Universe. It can be stored in an SLP compatible Wallet.
Common Wallets include the Electron Cash Wallet and The Badger Wallet.
The Links are Included in the reference section at the end of this document.
Use cases include any Credit, Rewards, Medium of Exchange and measurement of 
value in relation to the physical Universe where the User of the System Exists 
physically.

ADVANCED VIRTUAL AUTOMATED TOKEN [AVAT]

The Token(AVAT) is the medium of exchange for the network that exists in
the virtual or "Child" Universe. This can be stored in Wallets that are still 
being developed and will include a reference list once they are ready for use.
Use this token for use cases including Virtual Credits, Rewards, Medium of exchange,
and measurement of value in relation to a virtual economy. 

PROPERTIES
Total Supply of 1,000,000,000 for the Coin and
Total Supply of 1,000,000,000 for the Token

1 Coin equals 1 Token and the rate of exchange will always equal
eachother to keep the rate at a stable constant 
This will preserve the functionality of the network and fufill the purpose 
of being a Network that is used as an easy way to transfer values, integers 
or measurements assigned to the Token or the Coin 
Provides easy and quick access to the user whether they are in a game, or exploring a new virtual environment
or even pioneering and designing a new type of platform current not in existance
